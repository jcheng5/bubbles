THIS IS A FORK FROM THE ORIGINAL [https://github.com/jcheng5/bubbles](https://github.com/jcheng5/bubbles)

It's being adjusted  for my personal use with some extra functionalities.



## Installation

Use the **devtools** package (`install.packages("devtools")`) to install this package directly from GitHub:
